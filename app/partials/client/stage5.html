<p>In this period, your group begins with {{group.quantity_initial}} units of Zook {{session.period == 1 && '(chosen at random)' || ''}}.</p>
<p>The group will decide {{session.direction == 0 && 'both ' || ''}}whether to {{group.direction > -1 && 'increase to ' + group.quantity_up + 'units' || ''}}{{group.direction == 0 && ' and whether to ' || ''}}{{group.direction < 1 && 'decrease to ' + group.quantity_down + 'units' || ''}}.</p>
<p ng-if="group.direction > -1">{{group.quantity_up}} units of Zook is worth {{subject.value_up | currency}} more than {{group.quantity_initial}} units.</p>
<p ng-if="group.direction > -1">If the {{session.group_size}} Accept bids sum to at least {{session.cost | currency}}, your payoff will be the value to you of the additional unit of Zook, {{subject.value_up | currency}}, minus any excess of the cost over the sum of the other {{session.group_size - 1}} Accept bids.</p>
<p ng-if="group.direction < 1">If the {{session.group_size}} Accept asks sum to at most {{session.cost | currency}}, your payoff will be the cost minus the sum of the other {{session.group_size - 1}} Accept asks less the value to you of the last unit of Zook, {{subject.value_down | currency}}.</p>
